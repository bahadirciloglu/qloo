Insights API
Qloo’s Insights API helps you understand what people are likely to enjoy — based on their tastes, context, and preferences — so you can deliver smarter, more relevant recommendations. By analyzing patterns across cultural categories, Qloo’s AI identifies which entities, tags, or locations align most closely with a given audience, individual, or signal.

Here’s how it works:

Provide what you know about your user, audience, or scenario:
A movie they liked, or a musician they follow
Their demographics, tags, or audience segment
The city or neighborhood they’re in
Get back a ranked list of recommendations in your chosen category (e.g., movies, destinations). Results are ranked by affinity, allowing you to personalize experiences, target the right segments, and explore trends.
Key Benefits
Flexible Input and Output: Seamlessly processes a wide range of data types—entities, tags, demographics, audiences, and location—allowing you to input and receive highly relevant results across the same categories.
Extensive Filtering and Customization: With a broad range of filters and signal parameters, you can fine-tune your queries to ensure the results are precisely tailored to your needs. Whether you're focusing on specific genres, demographics, or locations, the Insights API offers the flexibility you need.
Versatile Applications: Suitable for live personalization, CRM optimization, product development, media buying, and more.
How It Works
Flexible Data Inputs
The Insights API is a simply designed endpoint that can take in any of the following data types and return any of the same data types as results to ensure highly personalized recommendations:

Entities: Retrieve recommendations for artists, brands, movies, and more.
Tags: Filter results by specific genres, cuisines, or other attributes.
Location: Query location-based preferences or signals to discover geo-specific trends.
Demographics: Include demographic data such as age, gender, and other characteristics to refine recommendations.
Audiences: Gain insights into distinct audience groups to better understand their preferences and interests, enabling more tailored and relevant recommendations.
All you need to include in your request is an entity category, like "artist" or "destination" and any other filter or signal criteria. Dive into the API details and get started or read more about our data ingestion and AI models.

Output
The output for the Insights API includes:

Affinity Scores: Ranging from 0 to +1, affinity scores indicate the strength of recommendations. Higher scores mean higher relevance.

Regulatory Compliance
Like all of Qloo's APIs, the Insights API is privacy-centric and compliant-by-design. Inferences are powered by abstracted location arrays and entity arrays, and require no personally identifiable information. Qloo's Insights route was developed to be compliant with bright-line statutory language, such as Article 6 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).

Heatmaps
You can use the Insights API to create interactive heatmaps that visually depict the concentration or dispersion of signal for an entity across various geographical locations. Heatmaps offer an intuitive way to explore and understand the geographic distribution of signals, uncovering insights and patterns in consumer preferences across different areas.

Key Features and Benefits
Qloo's heatmaps give you deep insight into geolocational data:

Visualize Entity Presence: Access a visual representation of the signal for a specific entity in a given area. This enables you to identify areas with a strong presence or preference for the entity.
Identify Hotspots and Trends: Easily identify hotspots where the entity's affinity score is highly concentrated and discover emerging trends or patterns across different geographical locations.
Make Informed Decisions: Use heatmap data to inform decisions about marketing strategies, location-based targeting, and understanding user preferences in specific areas.
How It Works
Heatmaps create a visual representation of a few key metrics. These metrics include an entity's affinity and popularity within specific geohashes. By leveraging these pre-calculated scores, the heatmap offers valuable insights into an entity's relative strength and popularity in various geographic areas. This enables you to visualize the concentration or dispersion of interest for the entity across different locations.

Each point in the heatmap is assigned three scores, providing a comprehensive understanding of the entity’s presence within the selected location:

Affinity Rank Score: This measures how well an entity (like a brand or product) performs compared to itself in the area of interest.
Popularity Score: This percentile score reflects the entity's popularity within the geohash, indicating its signal density within a specific area by comparing it to other entities in the same location.
Affinity in Geospatial Context: This compares an entity to other entities within a geographic location, both locally and globally. The affinity score provides a normalized measure of how much interest people in a specific location have in an entity, compared to other entities with signals in that area. This helps assess the relative level of interest across different locations from both a local and broader perspective.
Interpretation
By combining these scores, the heatmap uses warmer colors to indicate higher concentrations of signal, while cooler colors represent lower concentrations, signifying a more dispersed or less significant presence of the entity.

Location Insights
With the Insights API, you can explore consumer preferences worldwide. Simply enter the name of a location, a geo boundary, or a geo point to discover the most relevant and highly correlated music artists, movies, TV shows, consumer brands, fashion, restaurants, travel preferences, and more.

A combination of filters and other input featues can address complex queries like:

“What are the most correlated health and beauty brands to the Barbie movie in a specific subsection of Miami, FL?”
“What movies do Marvin Gaye fans living in Echo Park love?”
Key Features and Benefits
Put Less In, Get More Out: You don't need any prior segment knowledge- just supply a location. If you want to filter even further, you can filter byentity type, demographic criteria, and more.
Custom Geo Boundaries: Supplying custom geo boundaries in the form of multi-polygons and geofences allows you to target a specific neighborhood or micro-neighborhood. Geo boundaries can also span entire cities and any other arbitrary or administrative boundary, providing an easy path to localized personalization. For example:
the waterfront in Brooklyn, NY
the narrow primary retail stretch of Abbott Kinney in Venice, CA
the museum district in Paris
Custom Geo Points: As an alternative to geo boundaries, you can also enter geo points. This can be helpful for inputting areas with a natural center point, like a particular retail storefront or lease location.
No Cold Starts: Qloo's Insights API is able to generate rich geospatial inferences while completely overcoming any data-cold-starts or sparsity of existing data. The route can be powered entirely by just a single latitude, longitude pair. No DMP (Data Management Platform) data or existing entity arrays need to be passed to generate granular inferences across target domains. This empowers you to generate actionable, turn-key inferences with little to no existing data.
Integrate with Existing Tools: This route can be integrated with proprietary toolings or established DMPs like Adobe and visualization software like Tableau. It's designed so that a single developer can fully onboard Qloo into any pipeline and begin making granular requests across geographies.
How It Works
The Insights API can provide in-depth, location-specific recommendations using geospatial data and user interactions. This section explains the mechanics behind generating precise insights based on location, user interactions, and affinity scores.

Location
Geohash Tiles
If a shape is provided along with a signal array, the most relevant geolocation is determined based on the density of signals. These associations are mapped to a geohash. A geohash encodes coordinates into a tile that represents a geographic location. We offer seven levels of precision for our geohash tiles, ranging from about 118 meters wide (13,924 square meters) to approximately 625,441 meters wide (391,176,444,481 square meters).

This is how we can predict the taste of various tiles by analyzing the associated signals at various precisions. We employ a dynamic density discovery algorithm to ensure reliable geospatial recommendations over areas with differing densities. Generally, we can analyze sentiment at the highest precision in cities because the density of signal is so high, while in rural areas we will navigate up the geohash hierarchy to find a level of precision that is suitable for that area.

Precision Based on Density
By analyzing signals at different levels of precision, we can predict the taste associated with different geohash tiles. We use a dynamic density discovery algorithm to ensure accurate recommendations across areas with different densities. For example, in cities, we analyze signals at the highest precision because of their high density, while in rural areas, we move up the geohash hierarchy to find a suitable level of precision.

User Interactions
Signal Associations with Location
The Insights API produces accurate results by using signal associations that contain geospatial locations. When a user interacts with a specific location, like adding it to an Instagram post, an association is created between that location and the signal. If there are multiple locations in a signal array, that means the signal has occurred with each of the locations. If there are repeated interactions with a location, it will increase its weight.

Affinity Score
To determine the most important and relevant entities for a selected geographical point, Insights uses an affinity score. Learn more.

Affinity
A basic overview of affinity scores and why they are useful.

What's an Affinity Score?
Affinity scores are Qloo's way of measuring how closely two things are connected, like how much a specific audience in New York City loves a particular music artist. It quantifies the strength of relationships between inputs—like demographics or geolocations—and their most relevant outputs.

Affinity scores range from 0 to 100, with 100 being a perfect match and 0 meaning no correlation. These scores are powered by a sophisticated blend of AI models, proprietary algorithms, and carefully curated data. You can use affinity scores to gain insight into audience preferences, behaviors, and relationships across different categories. The meaning and application of an affinity score can vary depending on the use case, making it a versatile tool.

📘
Explore the Business Context

For a broader, business-oriented perspective on affinity scores, check out our blog post on affinity scores. It's a great starting point for understanding the bigger picture of how affinity scores create value.

How It Works
We begin by ingesting anonymized data signals that capture behaviors, preferences, and patterns. This data forms the backbone of our AI pipeline, powering models that uncover meaningful connections between entities while maintaining strict privacy standards.

Once processed, our AI analyzes these signals to identify relationships, evaluate geospatial relevance, and extract the most meaningful tags. We find correlations between entities and output an affinity score to represent how closely related these entities are. Depending on the use case, this process may instead determine an entity’s relevance to a specific location or generate descriptive tags for a collection of inputs. For a deeper look at the affinity score calculation process, see Affinity Score Methodology.

Why It Works
The affinity score is a powerful tool for uncovering what resonates most with your audience. Combining scores, rankings, and real-world relevance helps identify meaningful connections and drive more intelligent decisions. Powered by advanced machine learning and a rich, anonymized dataset, Qloo’s approach delivers highly accurate insights adaptable to diverse business needs.

Real-World Applications
Here are some ways you might use affinity scores for your business:

Marketing Campaigns: Tailor content to audiences by ranking entities based on relevance.
Example: A retailer can identify clothing brands most aligned with 30-year-old women in NYC, helping them optimize product recommendations and personalized advertising.

Geospatial Analysis: Understand interest levels in specific locations.
Example: A restaurant chain discovers its brand has a higher affinity in Austin, TX, compared to other regions. They use this insight to focus expansion efforts, adjust menu offerings for local tastes, and launch hyper-local marketing campaigns.

Cross-Category Insights: Identify relationships across different entity types.
Example: A query for a demographic shows affinities between a band and a travel destination, helping a travel company partner with music platforms for co-branded promotions.

Product Development: Use affinity scores to inform product creation by understanding what resonates with target audiences.
Example: A tech company finds mindfulness apps resonate with fitness-focused users and prioritizes similar features in their new wearable device.

Interpreting Affinity Scores
A guide to interpreting affinity scores: use cases, score ranges, and how query narrowing impacts results.

Affinity scores provide a quantitative measure of the strength of relationships between inputs (such as entities, locations, or preferences) and their most relevant outputs. They adapt to various contexts like entity recommendations, geospatial insights, or taste analysis. They range from 0 to 100 and are expressed as a percentage:

0 indicates no correlation.
100 represents a perfect match.
Use Cases
The interpretation of an affinity score varies depending on the context:

Basic Insights: Measures how similar one entity is to another. A high score means the two entities are highly similar (determined by the cosine similarity of their embeddings).
Example: Exploring how similar two music artists are based on the preferences and behaviors of their shared audience.

Location Insights: Evaluates the significance of an entity in a specific location compared to other entities in that location. A high score indicates that an entity is particularly relevant to a specific location compared to others in that region and globally.
Example: Understanding how well a restaurant appeals to diners in one neighborhood versus another.

Taste Analysis: Breaks down a list of entities (called a "taste vector") into descriptive tags that capture key characteristics or themes. The score represents the relevance of tags to a taste vector, with higher scores indicating stronger correlation.
Example: A list of movies might generate tags like "action-packed," "award-winning," or "family-friendly," capturing key characteristics of the preferences of users who favor the input movies.

❓
Still have questions?

Check out our FAQs.

Affinity Score Ranges
To help interpret the significance of an affinity score, we categorize the ranges as follows:

Affinity Score Range	Relevance	Example
> 80	Very High	Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter for a music artist query.
60 – 80	High	A local bakery and Dunkin' Donuts for a places query.
= 50	Medium	A sushi restaurant and a library for a places query.
< 50	Low	Chappell Roan and a historical landmark for a music artist query.
Note: Affinity scores may decrease as more inputs or filters are applied. For example, a score of 55 could still represent a strong recommendation, but including demographic data may lower the final score. Consider the context and input complexity when evaluating scores.

ℹ️
Score vs. Index

The affinity score measures the strength of relationships between entities, such as audiences, interests, and locations. When you submit a query, the index provides a quick and meaningful way to assess relevance by ranking results based on their affinity scores.

For example, in response to the query, "What are the most popular music artists for people living in NYC?", artists are assigned an index based on their affinity scores. Even if two artists have similar scores (e.g., 92 and 91), their index reflects their relative position in the results, with a lower index indicating higher relevance.

Step-by-Step Example
Starting off with a perfect match, see the nuance of how the results evolve as more modifiers are added. Let's say you start off simply wanting to know which music artist is most strongly correlated to New York City.

Step 1: Build a Base Query
To pose your question, you adjust the base query and add a table to your dashboard:

Base Query: Anyone from New York that likes Anything
Entity Correlations Table: Category is Music Artists

The system calculates affinity scores for all artists based on their relevance to audiences in NYC.


Don Q’s perfect score reflects their strong affinity among NYC audiences.

Step 2: Add a Demographic Filter
You add a gender and age selection to your base query input to see the differences between the preferences of NYC audiences as a whole versus women in a certain age range.

Base Query: Women aged 25-34 from New York that like Anything
Entity Correlations Panel: Category is Music Artists


As the preferences of women aged 25-34 shift the results, the strongest match for this demographic has an affinity of 99.51%, as well as a strong popularity score.

Step 3: Add a Genre Filter
To filter the results to pop artists and ignore more niche music genres, you add "Pop" to the base query as an interest. The system now considers only pop artists for this audience.

Base Query: Women aged 25-34 from New York that like Pop
Entity Correlations Panel: Category is Music Artists



Step 4: Add Location Specificity
Base Query: Women aged 25-34 from SoHo, New York that like Pop
Entity Correlations Panel: Category is Music Artists

Lastly, you want to limit the results to reflect the tastes of women living in SoHo only.


The system adjusts the affinity scores to reflect the preferences of SoHo audiences specifically.

This example demonstrates how affinity scores and ranking of results adapt as you refine a query, offering nuanced insights into audience preferences. By starting with broad relevance and progressively narrowing the focus, the system highlights connections that align with specific criteria, like demographic, genre, and location.

Affinity Score Methodology
Learn about the data and process behind calculating an affinity score.

Step 1: Gathering Data Signals
We start by ingesting a variety of anonymized data signals that reflect behaviors, preferences, and patterns. These include:

Consumer Activity: Transactions, digital interactions (e.g., reviews, likes, comments), and content engagement (e.g., views, listens).
Location Data: Patterns of movement and engagement within specific geographies.
Demographics and Psychographics: Anonymized attributes like age, gender, lifestyle preferences, and interests.
This data forms the foundation of our AI pipeline, enabling us to build robust models that uncover meaningful connections between entities while adhering to strict privacy standards.

Step 2: AI Modeling
Our AI models analyze data signals to uncover patterns and correlations that inform the affinity score. These techniques help identify relationships, evaluate geospatial performance, and retrieve the most relevant tags. Here are a few of the models we use:

Co-occurrence Analysis: Neural networks detect relationships between entities based on shared behaviors or preferences.
Geospatial Analysis: Models evaluate how an entity performs in specific locations compared to regional and global benchmarks.
Taste Analysis: Content models highlight similar attributes between entities.
Demographic Insights: Statistical methods map preferences across population groups.
These models support multiple meanings of the affinity score: they identify similar entities, evaluate performance in specific locations, and generate descriptive tags for a collection of entities.

Step 3: Calculating the Affinity Score
We calculate the affinity score by comparing the attributes of entities:

Vectorizing Entities: Entities are represented as data points in a multi-dimensional space, where similar entities are closer together, and dissimilar entities are further apart. This mapping helps identify relationships and inform recommendations.
Cosine Similarity: This measures how similar two entities are based on their vector representations. For example, two music artists with a high cosine similarity score (close to 100) might share a large audience with similar preferences, while a score of 0 indicates no shared connection.
Depending on the use case, this process may instead assess how relevant an entity is to a specific geolocation or break down the tags associated with a taste vector.

Affinity Score
Why are affinity scores useful?
Affinity scores provide actionable insights into the strength of relationships between inputs (like demographics or preferences) and outputs (like brands or locations). They help businesses deliver personalized recommendations, understand audience behavior, and make data-driven decisions across various use cases. Explore real-world applications.

What exactly does the score mean?
The affinity score measures how strongly two entities are connected, with 100 indicating a strong relationship and 0 meaning no correlation. Its meaning varies by context. Learn more.

Why does the definition of an affinity score vary across use cases? Is this a limitation or a feature of the system?
The meaning of an affinity score varies because it is designed to adapt to different contexts: evaluating entity similarities, geospatial relevance, or capturing key characteristics. This flexibility is a feature, not a limitation; it ensures the score remains meaningful and actionable across diverse applications. Learn more.

Why are the affinity scores for top results so close together?
Close scores suggest the system has found multiple strong matches for your query, reflecting highly relevant results. These scores typically represent the top matches out of millions of potential subjects, offering you a range of equally valuable options to explore.

Is there a meaningful difference if one result has an affinity score of 92 and another scores 91?
Scores should be interpreted based on the context of the query and the range of scores in the results. A slight difference, like 91 and 92, often indicates similar relevance, while more significant gaps suggest more noticeable differences in connection or preference. In most cases, the ranking of the results is more actionable than minor score differences.

Why are index and affinity scores different?
Affinity scores quantify the strength of a connection, while the index determines the relative order of results. The index prioritizes the most relevant entities within a given query, even when score differences are minor, ensuring that the top result matches the request best.

Is the score a percentage of a survey sample?
No, the score is not based on survey data or percentages of a sample. It is calculated using advanced AI models that analyze relationships between inputs and outputs, such as audience preferences or geospatial relevance. A score of 95, for example, indicates a strong connection between entities, not that 95% of people in a survey preferred it.

Audiences
Understanding Audiences
Audiences are curated groups of people who share common traits, behaviors, or interests—identified through data analysis of user signals. They range from broad categories, such as "LGBTQ" under "Communities", to more specific interests and behaviors, like "Vintage Apparel" under "Spending Habits." These groups are formed by aggregating positive signals from user actions, including following social media accounts, liking posts, and sharing content.

Taking Advantage of Our Audience Data
Use audience data across our tools to gain deeper insights, refine recommendations, and uncover new opportunities.

Get Audience Types API
This API helps you understand the different available categories of audiences. You can use it to see all audience types and find relevant groups to refine your audience selection when using the Find Audiences API. Learn more.

Audiences Methodology
Audiences are collections of valid signals accumulated through client interactions with our API. An example of an audience type is "LGBTQ". They represent the signal arrays that Qloo ingests for a specific entity.

To define an audience, we collect and analyze valid positive signals relevant to the entity. These signals may include actions like following an Instagram account, liking a related post, or sharing a tweet.

Methodology
We start by extracting all signal arrays (Signal Array 1, Signal Array 2, Signal Array x in the figure below) that include the entity. These arrays are translated into vectors representing different taste signals (Taste Signal 1, Taste Signal 2, Taste Signal x). These taste signals go through our taste analysis process to determine the total audience.

Signal Analysis
Analyzing these signals helps identify common themes and patterns, defining the audience. Audiences can also be categorized by metadata, such as genre tags (e.g., Jazz), or by geohash to understand regional tastes. By examining these audiences, we can compare the signal arrays of different entities, metadata, or regions. Additionally, tracking the velocity of signal accumulation helps us understand audience trends over time, allowing us to adjust recommendations based on these trends.

Entities
Entities are a core concept within the Qloo ecosystem, representing notable people, places, things, and interests.

Each entity represents a node that Qloo recognizes and has built inferential intelligence around. Qloo’s AI currently recognizes over 250 million individual entities, any one of which can be referenced to retrieve other entities correlated and filtered by taste and attributes. Entities are assigned a type, like "artist", "brand", or "destination". Find a complete list of entity types below. Each entity has a Qloo ID, a stable GUID used across the API.

👍
Entities vs Interests

You may also see entities referred to as interests.

Entity Categories/Types
Entities are classified by type, such as books, movies, and music. Below is a comprehensive list of entity categories:

Artist
Book
Brand
Destination
Movie
Place
Podcast
TV Show
Video Game
Entity Validation
We employ a multi-step validation process to ensure the accuracy and relevance of entities in our catalog. Entities must meet a minimum interaction threshold percentile to be considered valid, ensuring they have sufficient engagement for meaningful associations. Additionally, entities must contain adequate metadata and properties to support robust connections. To maintain data integrity, we continuously update entity mappings by reconciling information from multiple sources, resolving inconsistencies, and filtering out erroneous identifiers.

Metadata
Tags are a type of entity in the Qloo ecosystem that serve as labels, categorizing and enriching other entities to make them easier to search, filter, and distinguish. They represent various categories or characteristics that help define and identify the content they are associated with.

Tags include disambiguating details, such as restaurant addresses and film release dates, that help differentiate similarly named entities. Attributes span various data formats, from integers and strings (e.g., title, address) to boolean values and ISO 8601 dates (e.g., release dates). Some attributes also reference other entities, such as the relationship between a music artist and their album.

Some examples of tags include "Great Shopping", "Outdoor Activities", and "Foodie Destination". There are endless tags available in our system, making it easier to understand the information associated with an entity or drill down and filter your results.

Entity Reconciliation Service
For advanced enterprise use cases, we offer an entity reconciliation service that ingests client entities and provides a table of Qloo IDs matched to client entity IDs.

Filters
We provide comprehensive output filters for every entity category, covering sub-genres within music, film, and TV. Some filters are as granular as price levels for entities like restaurants and hotels.

How it Works
Filtering restricts the output to the most strongly correlated entities that match the specified attribute. For example, you can request the most correlated comedy films to an input array or the most relevant Japanese restaurants to a given signal. When multiple filtering attributes are specified, they are treated inclusively (OR condition) by default rather than exclusively (AND condition).

Data Quality
Qloo maintains a rigorous data pipeline and thresholding process to ensure that only high-certainty attributes are appended to entities.

Signal
Signals are consumer interactions with entities. They carry a specific weight, indicating the magnitude of the interaction. For example, a signal could be a user liking a post on social media. Signals can include interactions like transactions, reviews (positive or negative), likes, streams, comments, posts, and list inclusions. These weighted signals help to quantify and qualify user preferences and behaviors.

Signal Arrays
A signal array is a collection of signals. Signals represent interactions associated with an entity and a signal array acts as a bucket containing multiple signals. It can be used to represent taste and serve as an input when making a request to the Insights API. The provided preferences in the signal array influence the results of the request.

For example, a signal array might show an anonymous user reviewed Stranger Things, posted an image at Shake Shack, liked Beyoncé, and bought a hat at Supreme. This array consists of weighted signals associated with these entities, enabling us to learn and produce recommendations for this collection.


Diagram showing how a user interacts with multiple entities creating a signal array

Geospatial Signal Associations
A signal is linked to a geospatial location when a consumer interaction occurs at a specific place—such as tagging a location in a social media post or making a purchase at a venue. Repeated interactions with the same location increase its weighting, reinforcing its significance in determining user preferences.

When a signal array contains multiple locations, each location becomes an associated point in the array. If a signal is expressed toward Entity E1 at Location L1 and Entity E2 at Location L2, then Entity E3—sharing an array with E1 and E2—also inherits associations with L1 and L2. This enables multi-location inference, where entities connected through shared interactions gain spatial relevance.

For broader geographic areas, such as cities or neighborhoods, associations are determined by signal density rather than specific points. Locations are structured using geohashes, which encode geographic coordinates into hierarchical regions, optimizing location-based insights.


Signal Validation
The signal validation process includes bot detection mechanisms that assess interaction patterns to differentiate meaningful engagement from automated activity. This involves applying thresholds and anomaly detection techniques to identify and filter out bot-generated signals. Our bot detection framework is continuously refined to ensure that signal arrays accurately reflect genuine user preferences and taste.

Processing Methodology
How signals are processed, machine learning models are applied, and insights are derived.

Qloo’s processing and methodology transform billions of anonymized user interactions into structured, AI-powered insights. This process begins with raw consumer interactions, known as signals, which are systematically captured and processed to reveal meaningful taste patterns. Using proprietary machine learning models and statistical methodologies, Qloo translates these signals into actionable recommendations spanning categories like music, film, dining, and fashion.

Qloo’s processing pipeline applies:

Entity classification and metadata structuring to ensure a unified catalog.
Sentiment analysis and signal validation to filter out noise and maintain high-quality insights.
Aggregation of structured properties, such as restaurant menu details, book settings and characters, brand affinity scores, and more.
Core Concepts
Signal: A data point representing a consumer interaction with an entity, carrying a weight that reflects magnitude and direction (e.g., purchases, likes, reviews).
Signal Types: The different types of data Qloo processes, including consumer activity, location data, and demographics.
Taste Vectors: The final structured outputs power Qloo’s recommendation engine, representing cultural preferences through AI-generated embeddings.
From Raw Data to Signals
Qloo first captures and processes raw consumer interactions, known as signals, to generate personalized insights. These signals reflect real-world engagement with cultural entities and form the foundation for all downstream processing.

In the Qloo ecosystem, “signal” refers to consumer interactions with entities. These signals carry a specific weight, indicating the magnitude of the interaction. Signals can include interactions like transactions, reviews, likes, streams, comments, posts, and list inclusions. These weighted signals help quantify and qualify user preferences and behaviors.

Qloo’s API processes billions of time-stamped data points monthly, specializing in mapping cross-category signal occurrences. With a single dataset, we can identify transactional signals linking a specific fashion brand to a particular restaurant or correlate preferences for a music artist, TV show, and podcast. This unique capability allows Qloo to uncover meaningful correlations, such as the relationship between a music artist and a specific brand, providing valuable insights that transcend individual categories.

Signal Types
Consumer Activity: Transactions, digital interactions (e.g., reviews, likes, comments), and content engagement (e.g., views, listens).
Location Data: Patterns of movement and engagement within specific geographies.
Demographics and Psychographics: Anonymized attributes like age, gender, lifestyle preferences, and interests.
Transforming Signals into Insights
Once signals are collected, Qloo applies a structured methodology to process and extract meaning from them. This transformation happens in multiple stages:

Batch Signal Processing: Qloo’s API processes anonymized batch signals spanning various cultural categories, ensuring full GDPR compliance as a data processor.
Signal Decomposition: Raw signals are broken down into core entity attributes, forming the foundation for model training.
Model Training and Output: Machine learning models identify taste clusters, generating unique vectors for users, entities, and attributes, which are used in deep learning processes.
Extracting Meaning Through Statistical Models
After signals have been structured and processed, Qloo’s machine learning frameworks analyze their relationships. The next step is uncovering deeper insights by identifying patterns and cross-category correlations.

Cross-Category Correlations
Qloo leverages advanced statistical methodologies and machine learning techniques to process and derive meaningful insights from signal flows across categories. By analyzing patterns in user preferences, our models establish cross-category connections, enabling co-occurrence analysis that helps surface meaningful relationships.

Instances of sentiment for multiple entities are mapped using:

Neural Networks: These leverage taste co-occurrence data to uncover deep correlations by identifying relationships within a vector space and integrating signal-based taste co-occurrence data with content metadata and similarity metrics.
Content-Based Metrics: These analyze structured metadata to refine entity relationships.
Demographic and Psychographic Segmentation: These enable audience-based insights.
To ensure accuracy and reliability, Qloo employs rigorous evaluation metrics, maintains proper population sampling thresholds, and normalizes data capture velocities across categories and signal sources. This approach minimizes biases and preserves the integrity of insights.

The Final Output: Taste Vectors
The ultimate goal of Qloo’s processing methodology is to create rich, multi-dimensional representations of cultural preferences, known as taste vectors. These embeddings serve as the backbone of Qloo’s recommendation engine, precisely mapping relationships between entities. Entities are mapped into a high-dimensional vector space, where similar entities cluster based on inferred relationships.

Qloo’s proprietary neural networks process billions of structured signals to generate high-dimensional taste embeddings, optimizing recommendations across categories. To process all the data in real-time, Qloo uses proprietary machine learning algorithms rooted in the latest research in the emerging field of Neuroaesthetics. These include:

Deep learning methods

Representative Data and Patterns
Sample co-occurrence data and cross-category correlations.

Understanding Consumer Taste Through Data Patterns
Qloo’s AI-powered insights are built on billions of anonymized consumer interactions, capturing cross-category relationships that drive taste-based personalization. By analyzing co-occurrence signals, Qloo uncovers meaningful connections between music, film, TV, brands, dining, travel, sports, and more.

This page presents real-world representative data patterns, demonstrating how different entities are associated based on observed behaviors. These examples illustrate the breadth and depth of Qloo’s dataset and how it enables cultural intelligence at scale.

Core Concepts
Pairwise Category Signals: A dataset capturing the strength of co-occurrences between entities from different categories (e.g., how often a movie preference aligns with a particular fashion brand).
Cross-Category Correlations: Insights derived from Qloo’s AI models, showing how preferences in one category (e.g., dining) relate to another (e.g., music).
Pairwise Category Signals and Cross-Category Correlations
This section examines how different categories interact within Qloo’s dataset, revealing meaningful relationships between consumer preferences.

Cross-Category Transaction Examples
The examples below illustrate how single events containing cross-category entity co-occurrences contribute to Qloo’s understanding of cultural correlations:



Pairwise Co-Occurrence Matrix
The matrix below displays the co-occurring signal count for pairwise cross-category relationships, highlighting consumer taste overlaps across music, film, TV, brands, dining, and more:


Search Methodology
The logic of Qloo’s search algorithm’s methodology maximizes the accuracy and efficacy of search results based on fuzzy natural language inputs.

Search Representations
The initial logic represents each name in three separate ways, with each representation checked in every request.

Combined Word Representation
The first is by combining all the words in the name into a single search term that will be matched with any of its substrings that begin with the first character (edge n-grams). For example, searching The Big Lebowski will match with queries t, th, the, the b, the bi, the big, the big l, etc. A match with this representation is weighed heavily to ensure that a user who knows precisely how their entity is named and spelled will find what they’re looking for.

Individual Word Representation
The second representation is with each name separated into its constituent words. The words are individually searchable, and certain common words such as “the”, “a”, and “an” are ignored. Queries “big” and “lebowski” will each register a match, but these matches are weighed less than in the first representation. The query “big lebowski” will score highly as it matches two full words, but not as highly as “the big lebowski” or even “the big leb” which match the entity’s name correctly from its beginning.

Hybrid Representation
The third representation is a hybrid of the first two. Like the second representation, it separates each name into individual words, but it stores every edge n-gram of each word as well. This allows for imperfect and incomplete queries to yield helpful results. Matches here will be weighed less than the second representation. Since query “big lebo” will not match against the first representation, its individual words will match against the second two, with “lebo” awarded a smaller score than “big”.

Character Removal and Transformation
As the search function was intended to help users find entities based on how they’d naturally type requests, all queries and representations are stripped of most punctuation, capitalization, and formatting since human input of these aspects tends to be inconsistent. Certain characters that do not appear on a keyboard have transformations, such as Æ to “ae”. Other characters that are popularly used in an irregular way such as $ as an “s” in A$AP Rocky also have transformations.

Terms and Policies
