FAQ
Qloo uses proprietary predictive and generative AI models to uncover and predict consumer tastes and preferences. We leverage AI to make sense of our massive cultural database and globe-spanning consumer behavior data, looking for patterns in the data and making predictions about how much interest a person or group will have in a concept or thing. To learn more, check out our blog post explaining how Taste AI works, and read more about our AI and machine learning here.

Qloo’s data comes from a variety of diverse data sources, including proprietary first-party data, exclusive partnerships, and rigorously selected third-party data. Read more about where Qloo's data comes from on our blog.

Qloo’s intelligence can be accessed via API or through our self-service insights platform. You can also use data warehouses such as Snowflake, data lakes such as AWS S3, or standard network protocols such as FTP to access Qloo’s data. For extended compatibility, Qloo supports integration with data clean rooms, Customer Data Platforms (CDPs), visualization platforms like Tableau, and CRM platforms like Salesforce, ensuring you can connect Qloo’s insights with any third-party tooling to enhance your business intelligence.

Qloo’s models are powered by structured, factual user and cultural data, while LLMs are trained on massive amounts of freeform text. LLMs like ChatGPT are designed to generate text based on patterns learned from the text data it was trained on. As a result, they have major limitations—most notably, they hallucinate, returning convincing information to their users that is inaccurate or nonsensical. Qloo’s Taste AI, on the other hand, is grounded in truth—powered by user behavior and drawing from structured, comprehensive databases. It doesn't speculate based on thematic content but provides precise recommendations based on real user data and preferences. For more information about how Qloo differs from LLMs and how Taste AI can enrich your generative AI strategy, explore our LLM integration offerings.
